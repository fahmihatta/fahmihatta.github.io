Welcome to **Fahmi's Flutter Deep Link Project**! This repository contains an example implementation of deep links in a Flutter app, allowing users to seamlessly navigate to specific content within the app from a web URL or QR code. The project also includes a fallback mechanism to redirect users to the Google Play Store if the app is not installed.
